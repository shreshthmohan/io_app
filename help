// General help

1. Since sequelize does not support mysql DATE, we need to manually change it
   in the db schema. Here's how:
     "alter table Events modify column start_date date;"
     "alter table Events modify column end_date date;"

2. Import stuff from csv in to db:
     Place csv in /tmp directory for ease
     http://www.mysqltutorial.org/import-csv-file-mysql-table/
     some example commands:
       load data local infile '/tmp/events.csv' into table Events fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;
