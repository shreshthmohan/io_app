// General help

0. New database creation:
   CREATE DATABASE `io_app_imported` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8

1. Since sequelize does not support mysql DATE, we need to manually change it
   in the db schema. Here's how:
     "alter table Events modify column start_date date;"
     "alter table Events modify column end_date date;"
   TODO script.

2. Import stuff from csv in to db:
     Place csv in /tmp directory for ease
     run mysql -u root -p --local-infile
     http://www.mysqltutorial.org/import-csv-file-mysql-table/
     some example commands:
       load data local infile '/tmp/events.csv' into table Events fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;
    TODO: make a shell script for future
    Lesson: was having trouble with importing csv due to comma in field data values.
    Google Drive encloses feild data in " when exporting values taht contain , so to make things work properly use the following instead:
    load data local infile '/tmp/events.csv' into table Events fields terminated by ',' optionally enclosed by '"' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;

2a. Export data from MySQL to csv:
    select * from Users into outfile '/tmp/users.csv' fields enclosed by '"' terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n';

3. For using MySQL functions with sequelize (example: to format dates like 'date_format()')

4. Nginx configuration (in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled):
    upstream io_app {
      server localhost:8080; 
    }
    
    server {
      listen 80;
      
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://io_app;
      }
    }
    // still need to add directives for static files
