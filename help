0. New database creation:
   CREATE DATABASE `io_app_imported` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8

1. Since sequelize does not support mysql DATE, we need to manually change it
   in the db schema. Here's how:
     "alter table Events modify column start_date date;"
     "alter table Events modify column end_date date;"
   TODO script.

2. Import stuff from csv in to db table :
     Place csv in /tmp directory for ease
     run mysql -u root -p --local-infile
     http://www.mysqltutorial.org/import-csv-file-mysql-table/
     some example commands:
       load data local infile '/tmp/events.csv' into table Events fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;
    TODO: make a shell script for future
    Lesson: was having trouble with importing csv due to comma in field data values.

    load data local infile '/tmp/events.csv' into table Events fields terminated by ',' optionally enclosed by '"' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;

2a. Export table data from MySQL to csv:
