1.
Issue: Foreign keys not getting created
https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/1934

Solution:
User.hasMany(Task, { foreignKeyConstraint: true});
Task.belongsTo(User, { foreignKeyConstraint: true});

2.
Associations:
source.belongsTo(target, [options])

Creates an association between this (the source) and the provided target. The foreign key is added on the source.

source.hasMany(target. [options])
adds foreign key to the target
