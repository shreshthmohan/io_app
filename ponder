// This is for thinking about features, issues, solutions and potential TODOs //
// Basically anything related to io that comes to my mind. //

1.  How to handle brick-and-mortar retailers versus online retailers
    listing-wise and in the database? Also there are some retailers 
    who sell online as well as offline.

2.  How to handle things like NCR, Hyderabad-Secunderabad?

3.  How to handle aliases like Bangalore-Bengaluru, Mumbai-Bombay?

4.  How much load can an AWS-EC2 micro instance handle?
    Wordpress (PHP/MySQL): http://hubcitylabs.org/375-million-pageviews-for-15-a-month/
    For load-testing: blitz.io
    http://www.quora.com/Which-EC2-instance-size-should-I-use-to-serve-1-million-pageviews-per-month

5.  Models for social links, email and phone numbers have belongsTo only for
    events and retailers at the moment. When we add operators, schools and other
    endpoints. Will modifying MySQL schema be doable?
    TODO: Research
    DB best practices: building a modifiable database, something to which 
    adding more later is straight-forward and easy.

6.  Routes should mention id instead of just the name. This is useful for 
    avoiding confusion in case two endpoints have exactly same names.
    Also increases query efficieny.
    So the links should be like:
    http://www.indiaoutside.org/gear/bangalore/1/decathlon-whitefield/3

7.  Remember to display 'hand' when user hovers over any element they can
    interact with, like a link, a radio-button or a checkbox, especially when
    doing end-user side frontend.

8.  Beautifying links ... from www.example.com/city/23/retailer%20name/21 to
    www.example.com/city/retailer-name while taking care of #6

9.  Show more details about interactive elements on hover.

10. Character set and collation in Mysql DB schema. What it means? What to do?

11. New table for linked images (basically just urls). Also check how FB picks
    up images.

12. Analytics: How many views through newsletter, search engines, social networks. Outgoing clicks, stats based on activity, location and time of the year.
    Compare with existing data such as that of Google Trends.
