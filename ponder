// This is for thinking about features, issues, solutions and potential TODOs //
// Basically anything related to io that comes to my mind. //

1.  How to handle brick-and-mortar retailers versus online retailers
    listing-wise and in the database? Also there are some retailers 
    who sell online as well as offline.

2.  How to handle things like NCR, Hyderabad-Secunderabad?

3.  How to handle aliases like Bangalore-Bengaluru, Mumbai-Bombay?

4.  How much load can an AWS-EC2 micro instance handle?
    Wordpress (PHP/MySQL): http://hubcitylabs.org/375-million-pageviews-for-15-a-month/
    For load-testing: blitz.io
    http://www.quora.com/Which-EC2-instance-size-should-I-use-to-serve-1-million-pageviews-per-month

5.  Models for social links, email and phone numbers have belongsTo only for
    events and retailers at the moment. When we add operators, schools and other
    endpoints. Will modifying MySQL schema be doable?
    TODO: Research
    DB best practices: building a modifiable database, something to which 
    adding more later is straight-forward and easy.

6.  Routes should mention id instead of just the name. This is useful for 
    avoiding confusion in case two endpoints have exactly same names.
    Also increases query efficieny.
    So the links should be like:
    http://www.indiaoutside.org/gear/bangalore/1/decathlon-whitefield/3

7.  Remember to display 'hand' when user hovers over any element they can
    interact with, like a link, a radio-button or a checkbox, especially when
    doing end-user side frontend.
    Also not allowed hand like the one used in ixigo.com

8.  Beautifying links ... from www.example.com/city/23/retailer%20name/21 to
    www.example.com/city/retailer-name while taking care of #6

9.  Show more details about interactive elements on hover.

10. Character set and collation in Mysql DB schema. What it means? What to do?

11. New table for linked images (basically just urls). Also check how FB picks
    up images from links.

12. Analytics: How many views through newsletter, search engines, social
    networks. Outgoing clicks, stats based on activity, location and time of the
    year. Compare with existing data such as that of Google Trends.
    What about Google Analytics?

13. In a recent error I realised that node server should not crash on a error
    if it successfully started listening. It must keep running/listening and
    throw error in the browser.
    It seems the "error" will have to be handled by rerouting to some other URL
    when a query to DB returns an empty object.

14. TODO: Also allow editing of City in retailer/event.modify
    Also event_name/retailer_name

15. The date/datetime sequelize issue. Now what sequelize is doing is that it
    is converting entered date to datetime in UTC. Can be overcome by simply 
    using datetime with sequelize. TODO explain this thing properly 

16. What's the meaning of 'role' attribute in 'div' tag

17. What's bootstrap.css.map for?!

18. Rethink mobile menu?
      1. http://responsivenavigation.net/examples/simple-padding/index.html

19. Inspiration:
      Look: ixigo.com
      Design: Zomato.com
      Community: Nomadlist.io
      Miscellaneous: 

20. Frontend/Backend?
    Frontend now, then move to backend and iron out ...

21. Where is env being set?! See admin_app.js

22. Responsive menu: Using bootstrap default as of now. Experiment in future
    with the following or others:
      1. http://responsivenavigation.net/examples/simple-padding/index.html

23. Using Google's CDN:
      1. http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/003-Using-CDN-speed-up-your-sites/93388/103248-4.html
      2. https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide

24. The dilemma of hosting js, css, svg and such files for speed:
    1. Custom stuff has to be hosted locally.
    2. There's Google's CDN and bootstrap CDN.
    So TODO: update app accordingly.
