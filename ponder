// This is for thinking about features, issues solutions and potential TODOs //

1. How to handle brick-and-mortar retailers versus online retailers
   listing-wise and in the database? Also there are some retailers 
   who sell online as well as offline.

2. How to handle things like NCR, Hyderabad-Secunderabad?

3. How to handle aliases like Bangalore-Bengaluru, Mumbai-Bombay?

4. How much load can an AWS-EC2 micro instance handle?
   Wordpress (PHP/MySQL): http://hubcitylabs.org/375-million-pageviews-for-15-a-month/
   For load-testing: blitz.io
   http://www.quora.com/Which-EC2-instance-size-should-I-use-to-serve-1-million-pageviews-per-month

5. Models for social links, email and phone numbers have belongsTo only for
   events and retailers at the moment. When we add operators, schools and other
   endpoints. Will modifying MySQL schema be doable?
